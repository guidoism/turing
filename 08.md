(3) The various arthmetical operations, addition, subtraction,
and multiplication (division being omitted), also 'short multiplication'
by numbers less than 16, which will be much quicker than long
multiplication.

(4) To perform the various logical operations digit by digit.
It will be sufficient to be able to do 'and', 'or', 'not', 'if and only
if', 'never' (in symbols A & B, A ∨ B, ~A, A ≡ B, F). In other
words we arrange to do the processes corresponding to x y, x + y + xy,
1 + x, 1 + (x + y)², 0  digit by digit, modulo 2, where x and y are
two corresponding digits from two particular TS (actually TS 9 and
TS 10).

5. Fundamental Circuit Elements.

The electronic part of the calculator will be somewhat elaborate,
and it will certianly not be feasible to consider the influence of
every component on every other. We shall avoid the necessity of doing
this if we can arrange that each component only has an appreciable
influence on a comparatively small numbner of others. Ideally we would
like to be able to consider the circuit as built up from a number of
circuit elements, each of which has an output which depends only on its
inputs, and not at all on the circuit into which it is working. Besides
this we would probably like the output to depend only on certain special
characteristics of the inputs. In addition we would often be glad for
the output to appear simultaneously with the inputs.

These requirements can usually be stisfied, to a farily high
accuracy, with electronic equipment working at comparatively low
frequencies. At megacycle frequencies however various difficulties
tend to arise. The input capacities of valves prevent us from
ignoring the nature of the circuit into which we are working; limiting
circuits do not work very satisfactorily: capacities and transit times
are bound to cause delays between input and output. These difficulties
may be best resolved by bending before the storm. The delays may be
tolerated by accepting them and working out a time table which takes
them into account. Indefiniteness in output may be tolerated by
thinking in terms of 'classes of outputs'. Thus instead of saying
'The inputs A and B give rise to the output C', we shall say 'Inputs
belonging to classes P and Q give rise to an output in class R'.
The various classes must be quite distinct and must be far from
overlapping, i.e. topologically speaking we might say that they must
be a finite distance apart. If we do this we shall have made a
very definite division of labour between the mathematicians and the
engineers, which will enable both parties to carry on without serious
doubts as to whether their assumptions are in agreements with those of
the other party.

For the present we shall merely ignore the difficulties because we
wish to illustrate the principles. We shall assume the circuit
elements to have all the most agreeable properties. It may be added
that this will only affect our circuits in so far as we assume
instantaneous response, and that not very seriously. The questions
of stable output only involve the mathematician to the extent of a few
definitions.
