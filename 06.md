(ii) Use of the binary scale. -- The binary scale seems
particularly well suited for electronic computation because of its
simplicity and the fact that valve equipment can very easily produce
and distinguish two sizes of pulse. Apart from the input and output
the binary scale will be used throughout in the calculator.

(iii) Requirements for an arithmetical code. -- Besides providing
a sequence of digits the statement of the value of a real number has to
do several other things. All included, (probably), we must:

(a) State the digits themselves, or in other words we must
specify an integer in binary form.

(b) We must specify the position of the decimal point.

(c) We must specify the sign.

(d) It would be desirable to give limits of accuracy.

(e) It would be desirable to have some reference describing the
significance of the number. This reference might at the same time
distinguish between minor cycles which contian numbers and those
which contain orders or other information.

None of these except for the first could be said to be
absolutely indispensible, but, for instance, it would certainly be
inconvenient to manage without a sign reference. The digit
requirements for these various purposes are roughly:

(a) 9 decimal digits, i.e. 30 binary,

(b) 9 digits,

(c) 1 digit,

(d) 10 digits,

(e) very flexible.

(iv) A possible arithatical code. -- It is convenient to put the
digits into one minor cycle and the fussy bits into another. This may
perhaps be qualified as far as the sign digit is concnered: by a trick
it can be made part of the normal digit series, essentially in the same
way as we regard an initial series of figures 9 as indicating a negative
number in normal computing. Let us now specify the code without
further beating about the bush. We will use two minor cycles whose
digits will be called i‚ÇÅ ... i‚ÇÉ‚ÇÇ, j‚ÇÅ ... j‚ÇÉ‚ÇÇ. Of these j‚ÇÇ‚ÇÑ ... j‚ÇÉ‚ÇÇ
are available for identification purposes, and teh remaining digits make
the following statement about the number ùõè.

There exist rational number ùõΩ, ùõæ and an integer m such
that
