In the present section we shall only be concerned with what the
circuit elements do. A discussion of how these effects can be obtained
will be given in § 15. The circuit elements will be divided to
valve-elements and delay elements.

(i) Delay line, with amplifier and clock gate. -- This is shown as
a rectangle with an input and output lead

PIC HERE

the arrow at the input end faces towards the rectangle and at the output
end faces away. The name of the delay line, if any, will be written
outside and the delay in pulse periods inside.

This cricuit element delays the input by the appropriate number of
pulse periods and also standardizes it, i.e. converts it into the
nearest standard form by correcting amplitude shape and time.

(ii) The unit delay. -- This is represented by a triangle, thought
of as a modified form of an arrow

PIC HERE

The input to output direction is indicated by the arrow.
This delay element ideally provides a delay of one pulse period.

(iii) Limiting amplifier. -- Ideally this valve-element is
intended to give no output for inputs of less than a certain standard
value, and to give a standard pulse as output when the input exceeds a
second standard value. Intermediate input values are supposed not to
occur. If we combine this with a resistance network in which a number
of input signals are combined the condition takes the form that if the
input signals are s₁ s₂ ... sn there will be zero output unless
𝛼₁ s₁ + ... + 𝛼n sn ≥ 𝛽₁ and a standard or unit output if
𝛼₁ s₁ + ... + 𝛼n sn ≥ 𝛽₂. This may be simplified by assuming that
the inputs s₁ ... sn are always either 0 or 1 and the coefficients
𝛼₁ ... 𝛼n either 1 or -∞ and also by requiring the integral parts
of 𝛽₁ 𝛽₂ to be the same. We represent the valve element by a
circle, and the inputs with a line and an arrow facing towards it, the
outputs with lines and arrows facing away. (Fig. 1). A coefficient -∞
(inhibitory coupling) is shown with a small circle cutting a large
circle (Fig. 2). The smallest total for which an output is obtained
(i.e. integral part of 𝛽₁ or 𝛽₂ plus 1) is shown inside the circle,
but is omitted if it is 1. This number we may call the *threshold*.

When we require coefficients 𝛼 larger than 1 we may show more than
one connection from one source. negative coefficients may effectively
be shown by means of the negation circuit PIC HERE which
interchanges 0 and 1. Thus in the circuit of Fig. 3 the valve element
D will be stimulated (i.e. emit a standard pulse) if either A is
stimulated or both B and C are not.

(iv) Trigger circuits. -- A trigger circuit, which is shown as an
ellipse, differs from a limiting amplifier circuit in that once the
inputs have reached the threshold so that it emits one pulse, it will
continue to emit pulses until it receives an inhibitory stimulus. It
is in fact equivalent to a limiting amplifier with a cnumber of
excitatory connections from itself with a delay of one unit. Thus
for instance the two circuits shown in Fig. 4 are equivalent. We show
