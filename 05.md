Alternatively we may consider the delay line simply as providing
a delay, as its name implies. We may put a signal into the line,
and it is returned to us after a certain definite delay. If we wish
being delayed we do so. Otherwise we just delay it again, and repeat
until we do require it. This aspect loses sight of the fact that
there is still a storage medium of some kind, with a variety of states
according to the information stored.

There are, of course, other forms of delay line than those using
acoustic waves. 

(iii) Technical proposals for delay line. -- Let us now be more
specific. It is proposed to build 'delay line' units consisting of
mercury or water tubes about 5' long and 1" diameter in contact with a
quarts crystal at each end. The velocity of sound in either mercury
or water is such that the delay will be 1.024 ms. The information to
be stored may be considered to be a sequence of 1024 'digits' (0 or 1),
or 'modulation elements' (mark or space). These digits will be
represented by a corresponding sequence of pulses. The digit 0 (or
space) will be represented by the absence of a pulse at the appropriate
time, the digit 1 (or mark) by its presence. This series of pulses is
impressed on the end of the line by one piezo-crystal, it is transmitted
down the line in the form of supersonic waves, and is reconverted into
a varying voltage by the crystal at the far end. This coltage is
amplified sufficiently to give an output of the order of 10 volts peak
to peak and is used to gate a standard pulse generated by the clock.
The pulse may be again fed into the line by means of the transmistting
crystal, or we may feed in some altogether different signal. We also
have the possibility of loading the gated pulse to some other part of
the calculator, if we need of that ifrmoation at the time.
Making use the information does not of course preclude keeping it
also. The figures above imply of course that the interval between
digits is 1 Î¼s.

It is probable that the pulses will be sent down the line as
modulation on a cariier, possibly at a frequence of 15 M???/s.

(iv) Effects of temperature variations. -- The temperature
coefficient of the velocity of sound in mercury is quite small at high
frequenies. If we keep the temperatures of the tanks correct to
within one degree Fahrenheit it will be sifficient. It is only
necessary to keep the tanks nearly at equal temperatures. We do not
need to keep them all at a difinite temperature: variations in the
tempurature of the room as a while may be corrected by altering the
clock frequency.

4. Arithmetical considerations.

(i) Minor Cycles. -- It is intended to divide the information in
the storages up into units, probably of 32 digits or thereabouts.
Such a storage will be appropriate for carrying a single real number
as a binary decimal or for carrying a single instruction. Each
sub-storage of this kind is called a *minor cycle* or *word*. The
longer storages of lenght about 1000 digits are called *major cycles*.
It will be assumed for definitness that the lenght of the minor
cycle is 32 and that of the major 1024, although these need not yet
be fixed.
