TODO more maths here

This code allows us to specify numbers from ones which are
smaller than 10e-70 to ones which are larger than 10โธโถ, mentioning
a value with sufficnet figures that a differenece of 1 in the last
place corresponds to from 2.5 to 5 parts in 10ยนโฐ. An error can be
described smaller than a unit in the last place or as large as
30,000 times the quantity itself (or by more if this quantity has its
first few 'significant' digits zero).

(v) The operations of CA. -- The division of the storage into
minor cycles is only of value so long as we can conveniently divide
the operations to be done into unit operations to be performed on
whole minor cycles. When we wish to do more elaborate types of
process in which the digits get individual treatment we may find this
form of division rather awkward, but we shall still be able to carry
these processes out in some roundabout way provided the CA operations
are sufficiently inclusive. A list is given below of the operations
which will be included. Actually this account is distinctly
simplified, and an accruate picture can only be obtained by reading
ยง 12. The account is however quite adequate for an understanding of
the main problems involved. The list is certainly theoretically
adequate, i.e. given time and instruction tables any required operation
can be carried out. The operations are:

(1) Transfers of material between different temporary storages,
and between temporary storages and dynamic storage.

(2) Transfers of material from the DS to cards and from cards
to DS.
